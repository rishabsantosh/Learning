      This Sandbox is to for playing with CodeSandBox and Github to see how both
      work together and how to sync in both directions
    </h1>
    <p>First link this sandbox to your github.</p>
    <p>
      When you've time experiment with this and learn how to update changes made
      here onto the original repository in Github.
    </p>

    <h1>Points:</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        When we want to open and edit a GitHub repository in CodeSandBox, open
        it through CodeSandBox itself.
      </li>

      <br />

      <li>
        When we want to just open and view the repository, we can also open
        through GitHub by appending "box" after github and .com in the url.
      </li>

      <br>

      <li>
        CORRECT, BUT CHECK
        To save a sandbox on GitHub first export the sandbox to a new GitHub repository.
        Then open the sandbox again and check if you have commit changes option for you.
        If not, that means you cannot commit changes from sandbox to GitHub, so delete the sandbox, and import the exported sandbox and save it, this should work.
      </li>

    </ul>
